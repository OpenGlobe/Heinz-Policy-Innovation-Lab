# About this site
This is the repository for the **Policy Innovation Lab** course at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University (Spring 2019). 

This course leads students through real-world projects where they learn how to apply methods to government and other organizations to enhance their interactions with citizens. 

I've created this wiki / repository to help others establish Policy Innovation Labs that teach current digital service methodologies at other universities and institutions.  Find something missing, or have a better way to do something?  Please contribute by opening a pull request to the larger repo!

At the conclusion of the first Policy Innovation Lab course, the students helped develop a first draft of a playbook to guide future versions of the course.  You can find that here:

## Quotes from students (Spring '19)

"I think that anyone who is really interested in federal government consulting should take this class" - Jana L.  

"This is a great pre-systems class. But even if you've taken systems this is a great class for anyone interested in applying principles of innovation to government and public services." - Gilbert R.   

“Policy Innovation Lab is all about getting comfortable with being uncomfortable.  The ambiguity of some aspects of PIL will push students to be self-starters, take initiative, and flex communication skills.  Immersing oneself in the agile environment for policy design will demand and strengthen your creative thinking, flexibility, and willingness to fail.” - Alex K. 

"This class lays a solid grounding for first-year students who have not yet had a project-based course. The skills developed in this class are applicable to other team-based projects in Heinz courses and for the Systems requirement later on." - Diana R. 

“This course offered real world experience in consulting and dealing with clients unlike most other courses. Even the frustrating moments were teaching moments.” - Peter H. 

## Background

In the spring of 2019 Heinz College embarked on an experiment with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to apply user-centered design principles and agile development methodologies to the creation of new policy and service initiatives.  The goal was to borrow lessons learned from other federal public interest technology services (18F, United States Digital Service, Presidential Innovation Fellows) and create an environment where students would work side-by-side with state policy makers to craft user-centered approaches to new policy initiatives. 

In the inaugural class the Policy Innovation Lab students conducted research, performed interviews, developed prototypes and delivered seven final minimum viable products (MVP) across the following challenge areas identified by the state: 

* Education and workforce credentialing
* Blight in Pennsylvania
* Improving food access
* Creation of a new Energy Office
* Understanding the economic impact of the PA Farm Bill
* Establishing a Dairy Resource Consortium
* Supporting the Pennsylvania hemp industry

There were a few courses that cover some of what you'll find here and are good resources when thinking about how else to design courses that help deliver public interest technologists for future generations.  They include:  

### Nick Sinai's course at Harvard
https://innovategovernment.org/

### Ann Mei's Hacking 4 Impact course at Berkeley

# The nuts & bolts

# How the course is organized
For our spring course I organized the class along four distinct modules: product / project management; user-centered design; prototyping and delivery. 

## Product Management

In this module we talk about the structure of small, multidisciplinary teams and frameworks in use elsewhere in industry that stress productivity based on transparency and iteration.  Students are introduced to basic agile methodologies and tools.  Students work to form their own agile teams with team members that represent different backgrounds including design, engineering, and product management. 

See the [18F Product Guide.](https://product-guide.18f.gov/index.html), and the [18F Partnership Principles](https://18f.gsa.gov/partnership-principles/)

### The Mission Model Canvas

Also in this repo. 

## User Centered Design

During this module students are introduced to user research methods and begin to engage their partner organizations through interviews, workshops and other activities.  Students are introduced to design thinking, defining a product vision, and coordinating tasks based on the outcomes of the user research. 

### Design Method Toolkits

### Example group exercise
Evaluate this Government form for usability violations, playing a persona of your choosing: https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/GettingStarted?NextQID=216&Selected=t#crnt

Document your experience.  Working with your team, share your experience with the government agency.  If you can submit an issue via Github, all the better!  Submit working suggestions based on your observations for considerations, if you believe they can be further verified with user research.  Steer clear of providing opinions that are irrelevant or aren't representative of a user's experience. 

## Prototyping

In this module we bring together the disciplines of visual design, front-end design, content design, frontend and backend engineering to begin to develop our initial prototypes in pursuit of an eventual Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the partner organization.

## Delivery: Bringing it all together

This module involves bringing all of the approaches we’ve learned so far to iteratively test our prototypes with real users in pursuit of a functional MVP.   Success in this module is not necessarily defined by having a successful MVP - for those projects that can demonstrate another, more profound and valuable need and direction (failing fast) through the testing of their prototypes, an opportunity for iteration on the original ideas is actively encouraged. 

## Final Presentations: the MVP

During this module teams will publicly post designs, code, documentation and the use case to Github under an open source license.  Students are welcome to continue exploring opportunities with partner organizations when compelling progress has been made. 

## Textbook

For the spring course we used Ann Mei's [Lean Impact: How to Innovate for Radically Greater Social Good](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/CM/detail.action?docID=5571254#).  I found it useful for helping to shape the context and the purpose of the course - primarily to make a measurable impact.  I include some readings below that are helpful supplemental materials.

## A few institutions worth noting here...
https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org/#/fellowship

> "The Aspen Tech Policy Hub is a West Coast policy incubator training a new generation of tech policy entrepreneurs. We just opened for applications for the inaugural 2019 cohort. The fellowship program will be held from June to August in the San Francisco Bay Area, and successful applicants will be paid ,500/month for their participation.

> The Hub takes tech experts, teaches them the policy process through a paid fellowship program, and encourages them to develop outside-the-box solutions to society’s problems. It models itself after tech incubators like Y Combinator, but trains new policy thinkers and focuses the impact of their ideas.

> Prospective applicants and partners can visit https://www.aspentechpolicyhub.org for more information."

[MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance](http://opening-governance.org/).  

> "Convened and organized by the GovLab, and made possible by a three-year 5 million USD grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Opening Governance seeks to build an empirical foundation and fundamental understanding of how the redesign of democratic institutions influences effectiveness and legitimacy in governance, to the end of improving people’s lives. A core group of twelve members is complemented by an advisory network of academics, technologists, and current and former government officials. Through both face-to-face and online collaboration, the Network is focused on assessing existing innovations in governing and experimenting with new practices and, eventually new norms, for how our institutions make decisions at the local, national, and international level."
